Dog Fact CLI
============

This command line tool prints a random dog fact to the terminal. Eg:

```
$ dogfact
Dalmatian puppies are born completely white.
```


Dependencies
------------

You'll need libssl, libcrypto and the header library cpp-httplib installed, as well as
gcc and make.


Build
-----

Simply run make in the project dir. This should produce an executable binary called `dogfact`
in the root project dir.


Execute
-------

Just run the binary, there are no extra options and arguments. You'll need a live internet
connection to call the dogfacts API.
